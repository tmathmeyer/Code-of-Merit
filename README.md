# Code of Merit

## A meritocratic code of conduct devoid of social politics.

This Code of Merit should not be necessary.
The fact that it is necessary means that
there is something wrong with the current
solutions in use in the software industry.

1. Software is like nature: it evolves,
and so the best implementation must prevail.
2. You will contribute, you will learn,
and mistakes are allowed.
3. Mistakes are not final and everybody
has a second chance.
4. Don't expect others to do your work or
help you with your work. 
5. Harassment as defined by law will is not
allowed. Questioning is not harassment. 
Repeated questioning after an individual has
stated their desire for disengagement is harassment.
6. Censorship will not be permitted. 
Seeking to silence an individual voicing
constructive opinions will not be allowed.
Silencing vitriol is not censorship.
7. This is a space for technical prowess;
politics have no place here.
8. Everything that makes a person an individual,
including but not limited to body, sex,
sexual preference, race, language, religion,
nationality, and political preference are
irrelevant in the scope of a technical project.
9. Everybody is different, so differences will
not be mentioned by anyone, even by the individual
suffering/experiencing/having/enjoying them.
We are all individuals seeking the common goal 
of improving ourselves and improving our collective project.
10. Everybody has the same rights and the same
opportunities to seek any challenge they want. The
chance to screw up will not be denied to anybody.
11. There is no room for ambiguity: if an
individual is ambiguous regarding a statement it
is up to the individual to provide more context.
Ambiguity will be met with questioning; further
ambiguity will be met with silence.
12. If a discussion arises that cannot be solved
in the space of the project, it will be discussed
in a separate space. Disruption of the project
will not be allowed.
13. This Code of Merit does not take precedence
over governing law.
