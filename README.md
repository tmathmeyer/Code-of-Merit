# Code of Merit

This Code of Merit should not be necessary. The fact that it necessary means there is something wrong with the solutions the software industry is trying. They should recognize that fact and not insist that their solution is the only solution.

1. Software is like nature: it evolves, so the best implementation must prevail.
2. You will contribute, you will learn, and mistakes are allowed.
3. We are imperfect. Recognize your imperfections and those of others. Understand that mistakes are not final and everybody has a second chance. Don't expect others to do your work or help you with your work forever. 
4. Harassment as defined by law will not be allowed. Questioning is not harassment. Repeated questioning after an individual has stated their desire for disengagement is harassment. The difference is clear.
5. Censorship will not be permitted. Seeking to silence an individual voicing constructive opinions will not be allowed. Silencing vitriol is not censorship. The difference is clear.
6. This is a space for technical prowess; world politics have no place here.
7. Everything that makes a person an individual, including but not limited to body, sex, sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality, or political preferences are irrelevant in the scope of a technical project.
8. Everybody is different so differences will not be mentioned by anyone, even by the individual suffering/experiencing/having/enjoying them. We are all individuals seeking the common goal of improving ourselves and improving our collective project.
9. Everybody is different but also everybody has the same rights and the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want. The chance to screw up will not be denied to anybody.
10. There is no room for ambiguity: if an individual is ambiguous regarding a statement it is up to the individual to provide more context. Ambiguity will be met with questioning; further ambiguity will be met with silence.
11. If a discussion arises that cannot be solved in the space of the project, it will be discussed in a separate space. Disruption of the project will not be allowed.
12. This Code of Merit does not take precedence over governing law.
